# Contributing

We happily invite any Hack4Impacter to contribute to our Slack bot! Please read each of the following steps below to see how you can get started.

1. Open or assign yourself to an Issue from our [Projects](https://github.com/hack4impact/slack-bot/projects) page.
2. Create a new branch named using the following format:
```
[your-first-name]/[issue-#]/[slug]
```

For example, if...
- my first name was `George`
- I assigned myself to Issue `#57`
- Issue #57 is titled `"Add email support"`

Then I would name my branch:
```
george/57/email-support
```

3. Do whatever the Issue asks in your branch.
4. Write tests (we use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)) in the `test/` directory that are relevant to your changes.
3. Make a PR between your branch and `master` that links to the Issue you want to resolve.
4. Get at least one other contributor to review your PR and make comments when necessary.
5. Merge your PR once it has been approved!

If you have any questions, just reach out to the Hack4Impact leadership for help. Happy contributing!
